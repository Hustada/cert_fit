               Kratos’ Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialists work with youth from age 5 up to adults training for their next competition. Our philosophy is based around increasing strength, power, mobility, and decreasing the risk of injury. This is achieved by focusing on form and technique before intensity. Exercise programs start with a base foundation for youth and increase in specificity as the athlete develops. Sports performance programs can be done through our group or personal training.
